# Rule-Engine-with-AST
A rule engine with an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parses rules into a tree structure, where each node represents conditions, comparisons, or actions. It evaluates rules by traversing the tree, checking conditions, and executing actions. Ideal for automation tasks like code reviews, issue labeling, or workflow triggers due to its flexibility.
